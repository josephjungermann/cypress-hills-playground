                    <p>Friday morning was not just another walk in the park for East New York residents.</p>
                    <p>After nearly a year of construction, the Department of Parks and Recreation and Brooklyn City Council and community board members unveiled a freshly renovated Cypress Hills playground and park.</p>
                    <p>“This is a totally new park. Our community is entitled to this; our community deserves this,” said Council Member Inez Barron (D-Brooklyn) standing on the park’s new multi-purpose athletic field made from high-quality synthetic turf.</p>
                    <p>The $6 million city-funded project comes nearly two decades after the last renovation of the site. </p>
                    <p>The upgrade includes not just a flood-proof turf field with two baseball diamonds and markings for football and soccer fields, but also a brand-new recreational track, reconstructed bleachers and two dugouts in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>
                    <p>“I’m so happy. This is very enlightening, and I’m happy to see the change,” said Adeline Bunche, 90, a long-time Brooklyn resident and member of Operation P.O.W.E.R., an East New York organization that advocates for human rights and equality.</p>
                    <p>Bunche, who has been a Brooklyn resident for 53 years, reflected on what the rebuild of Cypress Hills Playground and park meant to her, but mostly, the future generation that includes her great- great grandson.</p>
                    <p>“I’m glad they have a track. The kids need a park like this they can use every single day.”</p>
                    <p>Just two years ago, the field inside the park consisted of only a baseball and softball field. No track existed, the playing field’s clay was eroding, and puddles of water would pool on the infield that was surrounded by a badly weathered concrete grandstand.</p>
                    <p>“I inherited this project and the field was so bad,” said Svetlana Filipovich, a consultant project manager for the parks department.</p>
                    <p>The area was missing simple necessities that a lot of today’s public areas have.</p>
                    <p>“When I presented the project to the community board, people were saying there was no lighting. People asked for light,” said Filipovich.</p>
                    <p>The playground park now has new, energy-efficient LED lights surrounding the track so residents can exercise at night.</p>
                    <p>The design team also included multi-faucet water fountains at child and adult heights, misting stations to keep residents cool on hot days and rodent-proof garbage cans.</p>
                    <p>“I’m thrilled to see these improvements come through,” said, Martin Maher, Brooklyn commissioner of the Parks Department.</p>
                    <p>Maher, who has dedicated himself to revamping parks all over Brooklyn and is currently seeking bids on a $10 million construction project for Brownsville Recreation Center on Linden Boulevard, led the Cypress Hills Playground ribbon-cutting ceremony on Friday afternoon.</p>
                    <p>“This park is going to be here for a long time,” he told a proud East New York crowd.</p>
                    <p>The playground aims to uplift neighborhood spirit, Barron said. “Parks are one of the great equalizers of our community.”</p>
